This is an XSL for transforming a FreeMind_ 0.8.* mind map to S5_ HTML slides using reStructuredText_ as an intermediate format.

The nodes of the mind map correspond to the following text elements:

* The root of the mind map is the title of the document and the slides

* Children of the root node are slide titles

* Grand-children of the root node represent bullet lists
  
  Lists can be nested to an arbitrary depth but it is not recommended to use more than one nested level (if at all)
  
* Text in a note is included verbatim, with the same level of indent as the node it belongs to
  
  Freemind notes are useful for defining paragraphs, block quotes and preformatted (literal blocks) as well as special markup beyound lists and sections, like directive attributes.
  
* Nodes with *any* icon generate directives, or if there's no directive with this name, for comments. Note that this doesn't affect indent nesting of sub-nodes.

All elements generated by distinct nodes are separated with a blank line in reStructuredText markup.

You can use inline markup everywhere it is permitted in a reStructuredText document, including paragraphs and list items.

.. tip::

  * You can use the ``sidebar`` directive to emulate a 2-column layout, for instance for images.
  * The ``list-table`` directive is an effective way to create easily editable tables in a mind-map, since it is represented as lists (with the same length) in a list.
